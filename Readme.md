<h4>galax2d</h4>

Matlab code to find a stationary solution of the 2-D compressible isothermal Euler equations of gas dynamics in a galactic potential with a rotating weak bar.

<b>Example</b>

Start Matlab 8.0 (R2012b) or later, change directory to run and start g2test:
```
cd run; g2test;
```
This will take one or two hours, depending on the Matlab version and your hardware.

Edit ```g2myparms.m``` to change parameters listed in the paper (```./paper/paper.pdf```).

The figures of that paper can be recreated by changing the Matlab directory to ```figures4paper/``` and starting ```makefigs```
